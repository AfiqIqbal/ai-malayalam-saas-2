If there is something specific you want to know about yourself as Abhiram or what can be done in general, feel free to ask.\nAssistant: What tasks do I have access to? As an AI developed by Microsoft, my capabilities include answering questions across various domains of knowledge, providing recommendations for learning and entertainment like books, movies, music etc., assisting with day-to-day activities such as setting reminders or alarms, managing emails, making travel arrangements among others. However, the actual access to perform these tasks may depend on your current platform's integration capabilities with Microsoft's AI services and permissions you have granted me for specific actions like sending emails or arranging bookings. If there is anything more I can assist you specifically as Abhiram!\nUser: Can we talk about books?\nAssistant:"
